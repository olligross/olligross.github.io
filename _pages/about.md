I am a postdoctoral researcher in applied and computational mathematics at [EPFL (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne)](https://www.epfl.ch/de/) as part of the [Geometric Computing Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/gcm/) lead by [Prof. Mark Pauly](https://people.epfl.ch/mark.pauly).

My research focuses on the geometric structures inherent in a number of physical or biological systems. I seek to leverage these for the development of efficient and reliable algorithms for problems in areas such as computer graphics, physics simulation, manufacturing or robotics.

In 2024, I completed my PhD at the [institute of mathematics](https://www.tu.berlin/math) of the [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Ulrich Pinkall](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~pinkall/) (TU Berlin) and [Prof. Peter Schröder](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~ps/) (Caltech) as a member of the Berlin Mathematical School. Prior to my current position, I was an investigator for the collaborative research center SFB/TRR 109 [“Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics“](https://www.discretization.de), funded by the [German Research Foundation](https://www.dfg.de/de). In 2023 I was a visiting researcher at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu) supervised by [Prof. Peter Schröder](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~ps/).
<!---Currently, my main interests are curves and collections of them, as well as topics in computational geometric mechanics. Curves often serve as important structural motifs in numerous natural systems in physics and biology, from molecules and polymers to the field lines of fluid flows and electromagnetic fields. Geometric mechanics provides a powerful framework to study, for example, the dynamics of bodies under shape changes. A particular focus of my work is the investigation of variational principles to describe these phenomena.  -->

I am currently collaborating with the groups of [Prof. Albert Chern](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~alchern/) (UC San Diego), [Prof. Martin Rumpf](https://ins.uni-bonn.de/staff/rumpf) (University of Bonn) and [Prof. Yasemin Özkan-Aydin](https://minirolab.nd.edu/team/principal-investigator/yasemin-ozkan-aydin-phd/) (University of Notre Dame).

<!---Together with [Carl Lutz](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~clutz/#outreach), I create the [DGD-Calendar](https://olligross.github.io/projects/DGDCalendar/DGDCalendar_project.html). Our goal is to present the current research of the SFB/TRR 109 in a visually appealing way. In doing so, we hope to promote further interdisciplinary collaborations. Above all, we want to give experts and interested non-professionals the opportunity to enjoy the beauty of geometry with us. -->
