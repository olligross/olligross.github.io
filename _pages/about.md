I am a doctoral student in mathematics at [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/) as part of the [C07](https://www.discretization.de/projects/C07/) project of collaborative research center SFB/TRR 109 [Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics](https://www.discretization.de) under the supervision of [Prof. Ulrich Pinkall](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~pinkall/) (TU Berlin).
I also work closely with [Prof. Peter Schröder](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~ps/) (Caltech) and [Prof. Olga Diamanti](https://olga-diamanti.net) (TU Graz).
