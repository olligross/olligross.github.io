I am a doctoral student in mathematics at [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/) as part of the [C07](https://www.discretization.de/projects/C07/) project of collaborative research center SFB/TRR 109 [Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics](https://www.discretization.de) under the supervision of [Prof. Ulrich Pinkall](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~pinkall/) (TU Berlin). Moreover, I am a Phase-II student of the [Berlin Mathematical school](https://www.math-berlin.de/index.php).
I also work closely with [Prof. Peter Schröder](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~ps/) (Caltech) and [Prof. Olga Diamanti](https://olga-diamanti.net) (TU Graz).

Together with [Carl Lutz](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~clutz/#outreach), I create the [DGD-Calendar](https://olligross.github.io/projects/DGDCalendar/DGDCalendar_project.html). Our goal is to present the current research of the SFB/TRR 109 in a visually appealing way. In doing so, we hope to promote further interdisciplinary collaborations. Above all, we want to give experts and interested non-professionals the opportunity to enjoy the beauty of geometry with us. Feel free to contact me if your are interested in receiving a hight quality printed copy.
